## Stencil JS Starter

### My Approach

- I've built a simple grid container that we can use and import in our projects.
- It's structured so we can import an article structured as an array into our project.
- Then within the component it used CSS Grid and Flex box within a SCSS file.
- The component is simple so that we can use it as a basic structure whilst building our pages.
- The component parses the string as an input into an array.

- I hope this is the right way to do it. I've tried to follow the brief and use an array as an input and not individual props or an object.
